# Battleship – Turn-Based Web Game

## Overview
A two-player Battleship game built with JavaScript that alternates turns between players and visually tracks hits and misses on the game board.

## Features
- Turn-based gameplay between two players
- Dynamic board rendering based on active player
- Hit and miss detection with visual indicators
- Game state management for player turns
- Unit tests written with Jest

## Tech Stack
- JavaScript (ES6)
- Jest (testing)
- Webpack (bundling)
- npm (package management)

## Project Structure
The project is organized to separate game logic, UI rendering, and test files for maintainability and testability.

## Future Improvements
- Pre-game ship configuration and placement
- Turn timer to allow device handoff between players
- Icons of specfic user ship placements on the board
- Win condition tracking and game reset

## What I Learned
- Managing complex game state in JavaScript
- Writing and testing game logic with Jest
- Structuring a project using Webpack and npm scripts
- Debugging turn-based logic and UI updates

## How To Run
- Install package dependices by running 'npm install'
- Run the npm script dev by running 'npm run dev'
- Open browser and paste the following URL: http://localhost:8080/
